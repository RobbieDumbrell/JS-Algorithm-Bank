## What is this?

This is me practising some **algorithms** that I have either previously been tasked with in job interviews, CodeClan homeworks, or random ones that I have found on online practise/coding challenge sites. Completed using node.js with the Mocha npm module for testing.

## Why is it here?

Partly for fun, partly for me to practise algorithms for interviews, partly to showcase some alternative logic based code that I have created.

## How do I use it?

Feel free to have a look into the code.

To run the tests, after performing an `npm install` in the root directory, run the command `npm test`, also in the root directory.
